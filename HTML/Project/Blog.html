My essence is an amalgamation of my parents: the rapid wit of my mother and the unyielding tenacity of my father, endowed with wit and intellectual capacity inherited from both.
            
                            Speaking of intellect, I take immense pride in my mind and my prowess in discourse upon topics of my Competence. To substantiate my claim, during my early scholastic days, I ventured into numerous contests, which Leo can attest to, for he has lost against me. Since the seventh grade, I have been a perennial dweller on the director's list, and my intentions aim to furthering that mere Director's List into an award of With Highest Honors.
                            
                            I do not merely aspire to hone my erudition, but I ardently strive to refine every facet of my being that I discern to require betterment. With these accomplishments and my unwavering dedication, I stand forever pursuing the path of wisdom, intellect, and excellence.
